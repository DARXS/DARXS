# About Me 
  
## Hi 👋, I'm Danilo Adryel. :brazil:	

<div align="justify">
  
I am a Software Engineering and Automotive Quality professional, with experience in embedded systems and quality-driven failure analysis. My journey began during my Electronic Engineering degree, when I discovered the world of embedded systems and automotive innovation. Since then, I have been focused on developing and ensuring robust, reliable, and high-performance solutions for complex and safety-critical systems.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineering Quality Analyst, focusing on diagnostics and validation of infotainment systems, root cause analysis in post-production environments, and technical support for critical field cases. I have experience identifying and resolving hardware, software, and communication issues, using protocols such as CAN and LIN and professional diagnostic tools. My role also involves end-to-end problem management, close interaction with suppliers and global teams, and a constant focus on product quality and customer experience.

Throughout my career, I have built a solid foundation in quality, reliability, and data analysis, with experience in KPIs, warranty data, field complaints, and performance indicators, supporting technical and strategic decision-making. I have also worked in maintenance planning and control, asset management, and failure analysis, strengthening a system-level and data-driven mindset.

In addition to my professional experience, I led the Electronics Team at Mangue Baja SAE UFPE, contributing to the complete development of the off-road vehicle’s embedded system — from firmware development and sensor integration to electrical/electronic architecture definition and system validation following the V-Model methodology.
